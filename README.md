# SoulJars
SoulJars is a [Slimefun4](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/) Addon.<br>
You need to install Slimefun4 in order for this plugin to work.

SoulJars is a Slimefun4 Addon that is heavily inspired by the famous mod [SoulShards](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/soul-shards-respawn).
It adds new items to Slimefun called "Soul Jars".
Similar to the mod you are able to capture mobs' souls. 
You are then able to craft Broken Spawners with these Soul Jars, repair them and therefore create a Spawner out of any mob you like.
This Plugin does have a config-option to enable/disable any soul jar though. So check out SoulJars' config.yml file too.
